  abstract = {Applications structured as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of tasks occur in many domains, including popular scientific workflows. DAG scheduling has thus received an enormous amount of attention. Many of the popular DAG scheduling heuristics make scheduling decisions based on path lengths. At large scale compute platforms are subject to various types of failures with non-negligible probabilities of occurrence. Failures that have recently received increased attention are “silent errors,” which cause data corruption. Tolerating silent errors is done by checking the validity of computed results and possibly re-executing a task from scratch. The execution time of a task then becomes a random variable, and so do path lengths in a DAG. Unfortunately, computing the expected makespan of a DAG (and equivalently computing expected path lengths in a DAG) is a computationally difficult problem. Consequently, designing effective scheduling heuristics in this context is challenging. In this work, we propose an algorithm that computes a first order approximation of the expected makespan of a DAG when tasks are subject to silent errors. We find that our proposed approximation outperforms previously proposed approaches both in terms of approximation error and of speed.}

  abstract = {We consider a variant of the well-known, NP-complete problem of minimum cut linear arrangement for directed acyclic graphs. In this variant, we are given a directed acyclic graph and we are asked to find a topological ordering such that the maximum number of cut edges at any point in this ordering is minimum. In our variant, the vertices and edges have weights, and the aim is to minimize the maximum weight of cut edges in addition to the weight of the last vertex before the cut. There is a known, polynomial time algorithm (Liu, 1987 [17]) for the cases where the input graph is a rooted tree. We focus on the instances where the input graph is a directed series-parallel graph, and propose a polynomial time algorithm, thus expanding the class of graphs for which a polynomial time algorithm is known. Directed acyclic graphs are used to model scientific applications where the vertices correspond to the tasks of a given application and the edges represent the dependencies between the tasks. In such models, the problem we address reads as minimizing the peak memory requirement in an execution of the application. Our work, combined with Liu's work on rooted trees addresses this practical problem in two important classes of applications.}

  abstract = {Development of application specific accelerators for deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have mainly focussed on accelerating the computationally intensive layers, that is the convolutional layers, to improve performance and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches in this space have relied on handcrafted dataflow implementations to leverage the fine-grained parallelism and data-locality properties within these layers. However, ConvNets layers also have an untapped potential from cross-layer data locality.In our work, we explore a novel approach in the context of deep neural networks accelerators by modelling the computation as a task-dependency directed acyclic graph and proposing a memory-aware heuristic based onHeterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) for task-graph scheduling on shared memory systems.Our results show the benefits of task graphs in terms of better memory use (23.4 \% less) over conventional layer-by-layer processing in a simulated environment with the first three layers of LeNet-5. Certain task-graphs trade-off makespan (10\% increase) for memory use (20 \% decrease). Finally, our exploration of graphs with different slicing configurations for the pooling layer while using memory-aware HEFT versus the original HEFT reveals that regular shaped tiles across layers offers better makespan and memory use than tiles with large dimensions along one axis.},

  abstract = {Optimal task scheduling in a multiprocessor environment is known to be an NP-hard problem. The research efforts in this area have focused on heuristic methods for efficient distribution of tasks. This paper introduces two static task scheduling algorithms. The first algorithm, called Heavy Node First (HNF), is based on a local analysis of program graph nodes at each level. The second algorithm, called Weighted Length (WL), considers a more global view of the program graph and takes into account the relationship among the nodes at different levels. The two algorithms are compared to the classical Critical Path Method (CPM). For a given Directed Acyclic Graph of n nodes representing a program, it is shown that HNF requires O(n log(n)) steps while WL and CPM require O(n2) steps to accomplish the allocation. The nontrivial worst case performances of the three algorithms are analytically evaluated and their average case performances are evaluated through a simulation study. It is shown that the performance of the three algorithms, which is measured in terms of program execution time and processors' idle time, is almost the same. Therefore, taking into account the time complexity of the task distribution itself, we conclude that a simple and fast heuristic algorithm, such as HNF, may be sufficient to achieve adequate performance.}
